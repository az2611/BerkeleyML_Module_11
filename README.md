**1. Determine Business Objectives**
  
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model allowing to predict with confidence the price of a car, and to identify the key features that determine the price of a car.

**2. Assess Situation**  
  
The provided dataset contains information on 426K and 17 features (numerical and categorical).  
  
**3.Determine Data Mining Goals**  
  
The data analysis goals for this project include, performin *Feature Selection* to identify the top features that determine the price of a car.
  
**4.Produce Project Plan**
  
- Perform Data Preparation, including hot encoding for categorical features.
- Standardize data
- Develop a linear model that include hyperparameter optimization.

According to our analysis we reached the following conclusions:

    Model Year has the biggest impact and can be considered the most important reature to predict the price of a car.
    Recent models years (from 2013 and higher) have the highest impact on the price of a car.
    Forward drive can impact negatively the value of a car.
    Diesel Engine contribute to increase the value of a car.
    Truck also contribute positively to the price of a car vs. sedan that can actually impact negatively in the price.
    Convertible contributes positely to a price
    Manufacturers such as Dodge and Toyota can put a premium on the price.

For example,

    A 2019 Dodge Diesel Truck will have a higher price than a similar truck from another brand.
    A 2020 convertible toyota sedan (diesel), will price better than a 2020 non-convertible Toyota sedan (gasoline).
